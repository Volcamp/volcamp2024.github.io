Passionate about mathematics and logic, I am a backend developer with a Computer Science Engineering degree and international speaker since 2020. Argentinian and Spanish, I lived in many countries and speak five languages. I strongly believe in diversity in tech and started giving conferences to act as a role model for women. Outside work, I love dancing, and travelling and have two wonderful cats.

I have been giving conferences since 2020 in French and English (but also speak Spanish and Portuguese).

I have been to major events like SymfonyCon, SymfonyLive, ForumPHP among others.
